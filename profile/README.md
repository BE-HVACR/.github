# Building Energy and HVAC&R Research Group 

Buildings consumed 40% of the energy and represented 40% of the carbon emissions in the United States. 
This is more than any other sector of the U.S. economy, including transportation and industry. 
Enhancing building efficiency represents one of the easiest, most immediate, and most cost-effective ways to reduce energy consumption while keeping buildings sustainable and healthy. 
Dr. Zheng Oâ€™Neill and her research group are doing something about that by exploring fundamental challenges and emerging technologies for smart and healthy buildings.

This group is a highly collabrative environment, which requires efficient cooperation among memebers especially those who are working on the same research project.
Here we briefly introduce our workflow for collobration and some guidelines for efficient project management and software development.
